# Credit Risk Prediction & Automated Loan Approval System

An end-to-end **Machine Learning application** that predicts **Credit Risk Scores** and automates **Loan Approval Decisions** using financial and behavioral data.  
Built with **Streamlit**, this project integrates data preprocessing, model training, explainability (SHAP), and an interactive user interface.

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **machine learning** can assist financial institutions in evaluating loan applications efficiently and accurately.  
It includes two main predictive models **(Regression)**  and (Classification)**  

This project aims to:
- Predict the **credit risk score** (0–100) of applicants based on their financial indicators.
- Automate **loan approval** decisions using the predicted risk score and key credit metrics.
- Provide **interpretable insights** to support decision transparency.
